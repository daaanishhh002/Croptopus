## 📌 Project Overview
The SMART Crop Recommendation System is designed to **revolutionize crop breeding** by providing farmers with data-driven insights to improve resilience and yields.  

This system was developed as a **SMART Crop Breeding Recommendation System** to help farmers adapt to changing climates, particularly in drought-prone regions such as Dharmapur. By combining **soil analysis, atmospheric data, weather monitoring, and machine learning**, the system recommends the most suitable crop varieties and cultivation practices.

## 🚜 Problem Statement
In the village of Dharmapur, wheat farmers faced devastating crop losses year after year due to prolonged droughts.  
To tackle this challenge, we developed the SMART Crop Breeding Recommendation System, which leverages data and AI to provide **tailored crop recommendations** that help farmers make informed decisions and secure better yields.

## 🌍 How It Works
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Soil composition, pH, and nutrient levels  
   - Real-time weather (temperature, rainfall, humidity)  
   - Farmer inputs (moisture, pH, temperature, and location)  

2. **Data Analysis**  
   - Machine learning models analyze soil and atmospheric patterns  
   - Forecasts drought risks and expected yields  

3. **Crop Recommendations**  
   - Suggests optimal crop varieties for local conditions  
   - Provides irrigation, planting, and harvesting guidance  

4. **Farmer Support**  
   - Offers yield forecasts for better harvesting and marketing strategies  
   - Delivers personalized cultivation advice through a user-friendly interface
